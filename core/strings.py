I just registered you in my database so you can use all my features. I hope that's okay for you.
If it isn't, please use the `unregister` command. That will remove all of the data I store about you.
The only thing I will still keep is your ID so I don't forget that you don't want data about you to be stored.
Keep in mind that if I'm not allowed to store data about you, you won't be able to use many of my commands.
If you ever change your mind about this, use the `register` command.

Whatever your decision looks like, I wish you lots of fun on Discord."""
